Hi there!

I'm Roberto, a senior software developer with expertise in .NET Core, SQL Server, Entity Framework, RPA, and AI. I specialize in backend development, integrating REST APIs, and building applications with MVC, Razor, Blazor, and MAUI.

I am always eager to collaborate on projects involving these technologies.

Feel free to reach out to me through rguere@gmail.com.

Let's create some awesome software together!
